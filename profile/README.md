# Recover a golden sleep with your phone.
## Presentation
More and more people of all ages fall asleep on their phones, reducing their sleep time. This most
often results in a lack of efficiency in their day and a feeling of constant fatigue. Sleewell helps you
regain a golden sleep by turning your distraction into a real smart alarm clock ! By the simple action of
putting your phone on our base, your alarm clock will activate automatically and cut all distractions to
help you fall asleep. In addition, a personalized routine system provides you tools for falling asleep,
such as ambient sounds or a halo of light that will help you regulate your breathing. Wake up gradually
to the most optimal time detected by our AI to start your day in good shape. Retrieve all your recorded
sleep data using our AI and track your statistics throughout the year.

You can find a recorder presentation done on the Epitech Exp√©rience 2022 edition [live event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2GkneG9_oM&t=12313s)

## Innovation
Compared to the various sleep applications that already exist, Sleewell brings interaction with the
environment. With a simple gesture, by placing it on our base, the phone turns into a real alarm clock
and cuts off any distractions that may prevent falling asleep. In addition, Sleewell provides tools to
improve your sleep, with analysis of your nights by our Artificial Intelligence and sleep aids.
